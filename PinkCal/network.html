<p align="left">This page describes the limited networking feature of Pink
Calendar &amp; Day Planner. This feature is intended for small LAN environments only, such
as those found in homes or very small offices. </p>

<p align="left"><u>What the &quot;Share&quot; feature of PinkCal <font color="#0000FF">does
do</font>:</u></p>

<p align="left">When you select &quot;Share&quot; for a day planner entry
PinkCal multicasts the selected entry out onto the
network. Any <b> nearby and currently running</b> PinkCal will receive it and add
the entry to
its day planner. When PinkCal starts it will ask other PinkCal's for their
shared day planner entries. This scheme generally works with small numbers of
computers (e.g. 3 or 4) and small numbers of shared entries (e.g. 10 or 20 on
each computer), such as you may have on a home network or very small office.</p>

<p align="left"><u>What the &quot;Share&quot; feature of PinkCal <font color="#0000FF"> does not
do</font>:</u></p>

<p align="left">PinkCal does not broadcast the shared entry over the Internet.
It does not use a database to store the entry (which would be needed to store updates
centrally for later access by other clients).</p>

<p align="left"><u>What you may need to do:</u></p>

<p align="left">If your network gateways/routers block multicasts or you
have a firewall, then you must enable multicast on IP <font face="Courier New">225.23.23.23</font>
port <font face="Courier New">2323</font> for this feature to work. You can
change these values by editing them in the registry (Current
user/software/orange/PinkCal), but you take full responsibility for your
actions.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Note</b> that because networks are very
complex it isn't possible for me to assist you with yours. Remember this program
only costs $10. Consult the documentation for your
network hardware and software.</font></p>
