    <h1 align="left">Frequently asked questions </h1>
	<br />
	<ol>
      <li>Why is Pink Calendar called  Pink  Calendar?<br />
        &nbsp;"Magenta Calendar" sounded  funny.&nbsp; I wanted the program to have a memorable name.<br />
        &nbsp;</li>
      <li>How do I uninstall Pink Calendar?<br />
        The same way as you uninstall any Windows program, through the Control  Panel Add/Remove programs.<br />
        &nbsp;</li>
      <li> Pink Calendar Expired - what do I do?<br />
If you are a licensed user then refer to the email I sent you for
instructions, you need to tell the program you are licensed. If you are
not licensed, refer to the ordering section <a href="../pinkcal.html">here</a>.&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;</li>
      <li>My license code doesn't work. What do I do?<br />
The version you have is probably old, or new. If you are a licensed
user then refer to the email I sent you to see if you have a license
code for your version. Email me if that doesn't work (include the email
that you registered with).<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Can I install Pink Calendar again?<br />
        Generally it is safe to <a href="install.html"> install</a> a new  version on top of an old version (just not while it is running). You  can be extra careful by using the <a href="backup.html">Backup</a> feature.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Can Pink Calendar "network" or have multiple users share data?<br />No, I tried that for a while but it is too much to support for me.<br />
  &nbsp;<br /></li><li>How can I get Pink Calendar data from one computer to another?<br /><a href="dropbox.html">Click here</a> for how you can use Dropbox to do this.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>I installed the new version of Pink Calendar. Why do I not see  it?<br />
Most likely you didn't exit the old version before installing the new
version (Windows will not overwrite the EXE file&nbsp; of a running
program, and it doesn't complain either).&nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        Or you installed into one  folder but are running from another.&nbsp;<br />
        Or you installed an old download.&nbsp;<br />
        Or your browser has cached an old download and&nbsp; isn't downloading a new      one.&nbsp;<br />
        Or you already have the latest version.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Why doesn't Pink Calendar have every feature imaginable?<br />
My goal is to keep PinkCal simple. Having every feature imaginable
(like most software) would be a violation of that goal. Most users
(including programmers) curse the complexity of software.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>If I send you an email will I get a response?<br />
        I respond to 99% of email the same day  I receive it, but:<br />
        - I'm in the Pacific Time Zone, and yes, I do sleep at  night<br />
        - I get a ton of junk email; hopefully I didn't mistake your email for  Spam<br />
        - I don't read email that does not have a meaningful subject line<br />
        - if I am on vacation (rare) I may not have easy access to my email<br />
        - I do not respond to rude email<br />
        - on rare occasions email does&nbsp; get lost or take a long time; wait  a day or two and try again.<br />
        <br />
        Licensed users emailing me: please provide your email address that you  used when you registered for PinkCal.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Why don't you respond to rude email?<br />
If you want me to respond to anything
less than polite email, first send me about a hundred bucks.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>I'm a developer. Can I get the code for Pink Calendar?<br />
        First send me a very large check.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Is Pink Calendar&nbsp;software guaranteed to be bug free?<br />
Long answer: proving that software is completely bug free has been
shown to be mathematically impossible (due to the length of time it
would take to accomplish).<br />
        Short answer: no.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>What should I do if&nbsp; Pink Calendar is crashing on me?<br />
I have seen the weirdest problems fixed by downloading and installing
again. It seems that during the download process the file being
downloaded may be corrupted.&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Does Pink Calendar have any cool or hidden features?<br />
        Lots. Refer to my <a href="tricks.html">tricks</a> page.</li>
