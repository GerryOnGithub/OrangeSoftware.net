Regarding the 'app' called 'Rememberer':
</p>

<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>
Your data is your data. We want nothing to do with your data. The app doesn't have permission to access the network, so we can't access your data anyway.
</p>

<strong>Terms & Conditions</strong>
<p>
The app is the property of Avox Technologies LLP (Canada) but you can use the beta version for now. We make no claim as to the programs suitability for any particular purpose, nor do we claim it is fully reliable (let us know if you find any bugs). Since the program is currently free you can and should expect nothing from us (haven't we done enough?).
