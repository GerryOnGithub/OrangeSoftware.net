What Is FileSpitter Used For?
=============================
	FileSplitter is used to split a very large file into smaller,
	floppy-sized files. The large file is not removed or harmed in 
	any way. The split files may then be moved or stored via floppy, 
	and later the origional large file can be restored from the 
	split files. 

Splitting A File:
=================
	Select "Split File" then choose the file to split. If the file is 
	named "big.exe" it will be split into:
		big-01.exe
		big-02.exe
		...
	etc., creating as many split files as are needed. Each split file
	will be 1.38 Megbytes in size (which is all a 1.44 floppy can hold!).

Joining The Files
=================
	Select "Join Files" then choose one of the split files (e.g. pick
	"big-01.exe"). The split files will be joined together to create
	the origional file (e.g. "big.exe").

IMPORTANT NOTE:
===============
	The split files are just that, "split" files. If you split a Zip
	file into parts, the split files are not really Zip files! Don't
	try to unzip 'em! Similiar goes for other file types, like EXE
	files. Don't bother trying to "execute" a split file. You have
	to join the files and recreate the origional file before you
	can do anything useful with it.
